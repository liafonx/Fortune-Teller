# Fortune Teller

A Balatro UX mod that shows random card outcomes directly in hover info popups.

- Card description text is shown in a dedicated popup.
- Main info panel shows random-result card previews.
- Supports one-card and multi-card result previews with stable card sizing.
- Collection view stays vanilla (forecast UI is disabled there).
- Hover prediction is RNG-safe (does not consume random state).

Config settings are available in mod tabs for per-card enable/disable, popup display toggles, and debug/info logging.

For wording style and full user-facing details, reference `README.md`.
