- Hover supported cards to see what they'll generate or target.
- Card effect description moves to a small side popup.
- Works with single and multi-card outcomes.
- Joker predictions are phase-gated (scoring jokers show during blind, shop jokers in shop/pre-blind).
- Blueprint and Brainstorm show the copied joker's prediction when hovered.
- Collection view stays unchanged.
- Hovering never affects gameplay — your random outcomes stay the same.

Per-card and per-joker toggles, display options, and logging are available in mod settings tabs.
