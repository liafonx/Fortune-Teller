# Fortune Teller

Preview what cards will do before you use them — hover to see the outcome.

## What It Does

- Hover over supported cards to see what they'll generate or target.
- Card effect description moves to a small side popup.
- Collection view stays unchanged.
- Hovering never affects gameplay — your random outcomes stay the same.

## Supported Cards

- Wheel of Fortune (shows the target joker, or "Nope!" if it would fail)
- The Emperor, The High Priestess (shows all cards that would be created)
- Judgement, The Soul, Wraith
- Invisible Joker
- Aura, Sigil, Ouija, Hex, Ectoplasm, Ankh
- Familiar, Grim, Incantation, Immolate
- Purple Seal (highlight cards in hand to preview the next Tarot outcomes)

## Config

In the mod settings tabs:
- **Cards** — turn predictions on/off per card, toggle Purple Seal preview and Invisible Joker early display.
- **Display** — show/hide card name, effect popup, and badge labels.
- **Logging** — enable detailed logs for troubleshooting.
